Tic Tac Toe Game in C

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game repository! ðŸŽ®
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, written in the C programming language. 
It was developed as part of my first-semester college project to practice programming fundamentals and explore game development.

Features
Two Game Modes:
Multiplayer Mode (User vs User)
Single Player Mode (User vs Computer)

Computer AI:
The computer makes random valid moves.

Dynamic Board:
A 3x3 grid that updates after every move.

Input Validation:
Ensures only valid moves are accepted.

Result Announcements:
Declares the winner or a draw at the end of the game.

How to Play
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe-c.git
cd tictactoe-c

Compile the code using a C compiler:
gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe

Run the executable:
./tictactoe

Follow the on-screen instructions to play!

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (Player 1: X, Player 2/Computer: O).
The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Code Highlights
Game Board: Represented as a 1D array of 9 elements.

Input Handling: Validates user input to ensure only numbers between 1â€“9 are accepted.

Winner Detection: Checks all rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning combination.

Replay Option: Allows users to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

Example Gameplay
